**ABSTRACT**

Cardiovascular disease is presently the leading problem of death worldwide. An expected 3.8 million men and 3.4 billion women die each year from cardiovascular disease. Approximately one person dies per minute due to heart disease. Data is generated and must be stored daily. The data which is collected is converted into knowledge with data analysis by using various combinations of algorithms. Healthcare professionals working in the area of cardiac disease have their own limits and cannot forecast the probability of high accuracy in cardiac disease. Machine Learning is used across many ranges around the world. The healthcare industry is no exclusion.
Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of locomotors disorders, heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important intuitions to doctors who can the adapt their diagnosis and dealing per patient basis. We work on predicting possible heart diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. 
This project aims to improve heart disease predict accuracy using the Logistic Regression model of machine learning considering the health care dataset from the opensource of Kaggle datasets which classifies the patients whether they are having heart diseases or not according to the information provided in the record.

**ALGORITHMS USED**
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. Voting classifier
This project is about the prediction of heart disease by the combination of both logistic regression and Support Vector Machine using voting classifier.
The main objective of this project is to improve accuracy and performance of prediction by combining two best machine learning algorithms which has high accuracy, this results in the best model for prediction.
Voting classifier is a machine learning estimator that trains various base estimators and predicts on the basis of aggregating the findings of each base estimator.
